# 🛡️ Zeek Network Monitoring Lab

## 💡 Overview

This project demonstrates real-time network traffic monitoring and threat detection using [Zeek](https://zeek.org/) on an Ubuntu Server VM, bridged into a live network using UTM on macOS. The goal is to simulate an enterprise-level Security Operations Center (SOC) detection workflow, while building foundational skills for a future career in cybersecurity, cloud security, automation, and AI-based threat detection.

## 🧰 Environment Setup

- **Host Machine:** MacBook Pro (M2, 2022)
- **Virtualization:** [UTM](https://mac.getutm.app/) running Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS
- **Monitoring Tool:** Zeek IDS (compiled from source)
- **Network Mode:** Bridged to host Wi-Fi (ensures VM is on the same subnet as physical devices)
- **Client Devices:** Raspberry Pi 4, MacBook Pro, iPhone

## 📡 Simulated Traffic & Detection Scenarios

| Simulation | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `nmap` Port Scan | Ran SYN scan from MacBook to VM using `nmap -sS` |
| iPhone Traffic | Captured multicast DNS & Bonjour lookups from iPhone |
| Live DNS Queries | Detected passive DNS activity across devices |
| ICMP Echo | Verified network visibility using `ping` from/to Raspberry Pi |
| Zeek Live Capture | Monitored real-time traffic on `enp0s1` interface via `sudo zeek -i enp0s1` |
